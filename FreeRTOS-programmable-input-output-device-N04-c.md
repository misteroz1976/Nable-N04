# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   [Setup your IoT hub][lnk-setup-iot-hub]
-   [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub]
-   Ensure that the ***Nable USB driver for N04 GSM*** has been installed. If not, it can be downloaded from [here](https://www.eurosystems.it/DevIc/Drivers/CDCDriver/DevIcCDC.zip). After download unpack and install the driver.
-   Connect the __N04 GSM__ with its integrated USB service interface to your PC-side USB interface.

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

## Configure N04 GSM for Azure IoT Hub by using the DevIc Host tool

1. Download the DevIc Host tool installation package from [here](https://www.eurosystems.it/DevIc/Host/DevIcHost.zip)

2. Launch the DevIc Host tool and click on functions menu / parameters management menu

# Step 3: Connect your Device to the Cloud

1. Insert your SIM card in N04 GSM SIM card interface. The SIM card PIN must be removed before

2. Power ON the device

3. Launch the Device Explorer as described in [Provision your device and get its credentials][lnk-manage-iot-hub] and navigate to ***Management*** tab. Check the Connection State of your device in the list.

  ![Device List](./media/Nable_N04_device_explorer_list.png)

4. Navigate to the ***Data*** tab of the Device Explorer and select your device from the drop-down list of device IDs and click ***Monitor*** button. The Device Explorer is now monitoring data sent from the selected device to the IoT Hub.
